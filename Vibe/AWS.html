    <h2>Cloud Environments and Services in AWS: Top Interview Questions and Answers</h2>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q1: What is AWS and what are its main services?</p>
        <p class="answer">AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform offering services like EC2 (compute), S3 (storage), RDS (databases), Lambda (serverless), VPC (networking), and more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q2: What is the difference between EC2 and Lambda?</p>
        <p class="answer">EC2 provides resizable virtual servers for running applications, while Lambda lets you run code without managing servers (serverless), charging only for compute time consumed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q3: What is an S3 bucket?</p>
        <p class="answer">S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket is a scalable object storage resource for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q4: How does IAM help secure AWS resources?</p>
        <p class="answer">IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users, groups, and permissions to securely control access to AWS resources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q5: What is a VPC?</p>
        <p class="answer">A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of AWS where you can launch resources in a virtual network you define.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q6: How do you ensure high availability in AWS?</p>
        <p class="answer">Use multiple Availability Zones, load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and redundant resources to ensure high availability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q7: What is the Shared Responsibility Model?</p>
        <p class="answer">AWS secures the cloud infrastructure, while customers are responsible for securing their data, applications, and configurations in the cloud.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q8: What is CloudFormation?</p>
        <p class="answer">CloudFormation is an AWS service that enables you to define and provision AWS infrastructure as code using templates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q9: How do you monitor AWS resources?</p>
        <p class="answer">Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and setting alarms on AWS resources and applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-item">
        <p class="question">Q10: What is the difference between public and private subnets?</p>
        <p class="answer">Public subnets have direct access to the internet via an Internet Gateway, while private subnets do not and are typically used for internal resources.</p>

    <div class="qa-item">
      <p class="question">Personal Experience: Deploying a .NET API and Frontend Application on AWS</p>
      <p class="answer">
        About seven years ago, I worked on a project where I developed a .NET API backend and a modern frontend application. For deployment, I used AWS services such as EC2 for hosting the API, S3 for static frontend assets, and RDS for the database. I leveraged AWS Elastic Beanstalk to simplify deployment and management, and IAM for secure access control. At the time, AWS infrastructure was already robust, but since then, the platform has evolved significantly, introducing more serverless options, improved DevOps tooling, and enhanced automation capabilities.<br><br>
        While most of my recent experience has been with Microsoft Azure, I am eager to transfer my cloud skills and quickly adapt to the latest AWS services and best practices. My background in cloud architecture and deployment positions me well to contribute effectively in AWS environments.
