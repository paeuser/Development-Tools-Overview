                    <td>How does the TotalExpenses property work in Blazor?</td>
                    <td>The <code>TotalExpenses</code> property is a parameter in the <code>TotalExpensesDisplay.razor</code> component. It is used to display the total expenses dynamically. This property is marked with the <code>[Parameter]</code> attribute, allowing it to receive data from a parent component. The value of <code>TotalExpenses</code> is rendered in the UI using Razor syntax (<code>@TotalExpenses</code>), ensuring that any updates to the property are reflected in the display automatically. The <code>TotalExpensesDisplay</code> component is typically used within a parent component or page, where the parent passes the total expenses value as a parameter. For state management, the application can use a service like <code>ExpenseStateService</code> to hold and update the total expenses. This service ensures that the state is shared and consistent across components, enabling real-time updates to the UI when the state changes.</td>
