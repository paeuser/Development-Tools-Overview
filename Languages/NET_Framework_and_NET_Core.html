        <li><span class="q">What is the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core?</span><br><span class="a">.NET Framework is Windows-only and mature; .NET Core is cross-platform, lightweight, and modern. .NET 5+ unifies both.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is the CTS?</span><br><span class="a">Common Type System defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the runtime, ensuring language interoperability.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is the CLS?</span><br><span class="a">Common Language Specification is a set of rules for .NET languages to ensure interoperability.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is the GAC?</span><br><span class="a">Global Assembly Cache is a machine-wide code cache for storing shared .NET assemblies.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is an assembly?</span><br><span class="a">A compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security. It can be a DLL or EXE.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is NuGet?</span><br><span class="a">NuGet is the package manager for .NET, used to share and consume reusable code.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is dependency injection?</span><br><span class="a">A design pattern for achieving Inversion of Control, where dependencies are provided to a class rather than created by it. Built-in in ASP.NET Core.</span></li>

        <li><span class="q">What is a value type vs reference type?</span><br><span class="a">Value types store data directly; reference types store references to the data's memory address.</span></li>

        <li><span class="q">What is reflection?</span><br><span class="a">The ability of a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is a RESTful API?</span><br><span class="a">An API that follows REST principles, using HTTP methods for CRUD operations and stateless communication.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is JWT?</span><br><span class="a">JSON Web Token, a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, often used for authentication.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is SignalR?</span><br><span class="a">A library for ASP.NET that enables real-time web functionality, such as live chat or notifications.</span></li>

        <li><span class="q">What is the difference between Web API and MVC?</span><br><span class="a">Web API is for building HTTP services; MVC is for building web applications with views and controllers.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is dependency inversion principle?</span><br><span class="a">A SOLID principle stating that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is the difference between abstract class and interface?</span><br><span class="a">Abstract classes can have implementation; interfaces cannot (prior to C# 8). A class can implement multiple interfaces but inherit only one abstract class.</span></li>

        <li><span class="q">What is appsettings.json?</span><br><span class="a">A configuration file in ASP.NET Core for storing settings like connection strings and app configuration.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?</span><br><span class="a">Synchronous code blocks the thread until completion; asynchronous code allows other operations to run while waiting.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is a memory leak?</span><br><span class="a">A situation where memory that is no longer needed is not released, leading to increased memory usage.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is a deadlock?</span><br><span class="a">A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is a race condition?</span><br><span class="a">A situation where the outcome depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events, often in multithreaded code.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is the difference between public, private, protected, and internal access modifiers?</span><br><span class="a">public: accessible everywhere; private: only within the class; protected: within the class and derived classes; internal: within the same assembly.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is a constructor?</span><br><span class="a">A special method called when an object is instantiated, used to initialize the object.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is method overloading and overriding?</span><br><span class="a">Overloading: same method name, different parameters; overriding: derived class provides a new implementation for a base class method.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is polymorphism?</span><br><span class="a">The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same base class, typically via interfaces or inheritance.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is encapsulation?</span><br><span class="a">The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a class, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is inheritance?</span><br><span class="a">A mechanism where a new class derives from an existing class, inheriting its members.</span></li>
        <li><span class="q">What is a namespace?</span><br><span class="a">A container for classes and other types, used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts.</span></li>
