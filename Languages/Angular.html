    <h1>Angular Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

    <h2>1. What is Angular?</h2>
    <p>Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework developed by Google. It is used to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs).</p>

    <h2>2. What are the key features of Angular?</h2>
    <p>Some key features of Angular include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two-way data binding</li>
        <li>Dependency injection</li>
        <li>Directives</li>
        <li>Components</li>
        <li>Routing</li>
        <li>RxJS for reactive programming</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. What is a Component in Angular?</h2>
    <p>A Component is a building block of an Angular application. It controls a part of the user interface and consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and optional CSS styles.</p>

    <h2>4. What is Dependency Injection in Angular?</h2>
    <p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to provide components with their dependencies. Angular's DI system allows you to inject services into components, making the code more modular and testable.</p>

    <h2>5. What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?</h2>
    <p>AngularJS is the first version of Angular, based on JavaScript, while Angular (versions 2 and above) is a complete rewrite using TypeScript. Angular offers better performance, a modular architecture, and improved tooling compared to AngularJS.</p>

    <h2>6. What is RxJS in Angular?</h2>
    <p>RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables. Angular uses RxJS to handle asynchronous operations like HTTP requests, event handling, and more.</p>

    <h2>7. What is Angular CLI?</h2>
    <p>Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps developers create, build, and maintain Angular applications. It provides commands for generating components, services, modules, and more.</p>

    <h2>8. What are Directives in Angular?</h2>
    <p>Directives are instructions in the DOM that tell Angular how to render or manipulate elements. There are three types of directives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Component Directives:</strong> Used to create components.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Directives:</strong> Used to change the structure of the DOM (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor).</li>
        <li><strong>Attribute Directives:</strong> Used to change the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. What is a Service in Angular?</h2>
    <p>A Service is a class in Angular that contains business logic and data-sharing functionality. Services are typically used with Dependency Injection to share data and logic across components.</p>

    <h2>10. What is Lazy Loading in Angular?</h2>
    <p>Lazy Loading is a technique in Angular to load modules only when they are needed. This improves the application's performance by reducing the initial load time.</p>
