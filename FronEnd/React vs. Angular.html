    <h1>React vs. Angular: What’s the Difference?</h1>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">What is React?</div>
      <div class="answer">React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It focuses on building reusable UI components, uses a virtual DOM for performance, and supports both web and mobile app development. React is flexible and can be integrated into existing projects.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">What is Angular?</div>
      <div class="answer">Angular is a full-featured framework developed by Google for building web and mobile applications. It uses TypeScript, provides built-in tools for routing, state management, and testing, and enforces a structured, opinionated architecture for new projects.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">What are the main differences between React and Angular?</div>
      <div class="answer">React is a library focused on the view layer, offering flexibility and a smaller bundle size. Angular is a comprehensive framework with more built-in features, a steeper learning curve, and requires TypeScript. React uses one-way data binding; Angular uses two-way data binding.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">Which should you learn if you’re new to coding?</div>
      <div class="answer">React is generally easier for beginners due to its simplicity and use of JavaScript. Angular is better suited for those who want a full framework and are comfortable learning TypeScript and more complex concepts.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">How do you choose between React and Angular for a project?</div>
      <div class="answer">Choose React for adding interactivity to existing projects or when you want flexibility. Choose Angular for new, large-scale projects that benefit from a full-featured, opinionated framework and built-in tooling.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">What are some top resources for learning React and Angular?</div>
      <div class="answer">Both have extensive official documentation and community tutorials. For React: React docs, Codecademy, The Joy of React. For Angular: Angular docs, Angular University, Udemy. Both have rich ecosystems of UI libraries and helper tools.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <div class="question">What is the best way to host and deliver React/Angular apps?</div>
      <div class="answer">Host static frontends on a CDN for speed and scalability. Use composable backend services (like Contentful) to manage and deliver content efficiently to your users.</div>
