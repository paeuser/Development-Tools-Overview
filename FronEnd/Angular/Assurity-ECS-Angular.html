                    <strong>Introduction for Business Users</strong><br>
                    The Assurity ECS Angular App is the main web interface for the Assurity platform. It allows business users to easily view, manage, and interact with products, customers, and business processes from any device with a web browser. The app is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and secure, making it simple for users to get their work done efficiently.
                </p>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <strong>What version of Angular was used?</strong><br>
                    The application is built with <strong>Angular version 14</strong> (see <code>package.json</code> for details).
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <strong>What test framework was used?</strong><br>
                    The app uses <strong>Karma</strong> and <strong>Jasmine</strong> for automated testing, which are standard for Angular projects.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <strong>How does this app call the API and external sites?</strong><br>
                    The Angular app communicates with the Assurity ECS API using secure HTTP (REST) requests. It sends and receives data such as product information, user details, and business actions. For authentication, it uses secure tokens (JWT) provided by the backend. The app can also connect to external services (like e-signature or email providers) through the backend API, ensuring all integrations are managed securely and centrally.

                <h5>What is Bootstrap?</h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bootstrap</strong> is a popular open-source CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first web applications quickly and easily. It provides a collection of ready-to-use CSS classes and JavaScript components for layout, typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and more. By using Bootstrap, developers can ensure their applications look modern and work well on all devices without writing a lot of custom CSS.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Automatically adapts layouts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prebuilt Components:</strong> Includes cards, modals, navbars, alerts, and more for rapid UI development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistent Styling:</strong> Ensures a professional and uniform look across the application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable:</strong> You can override Bootstrap styles with your own CSS or use its utility classes for quick adjustments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In this project, Bootstrap is used to create a clean, user-friendly interface and to make sure the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices. For example, the <code>container</code>, <code>card</code>, <code>mb-3</code>, and <code>shadow</code> classes in this page are all from Bootstrap.
                </p>

                    <strong>Common Interview Questions You Can Answer from This Project:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How do you structure a large Angular application for maintainability and scalability?</strong><br>
                        The project uses a modular architecture, separating features into dedicated modules (feature, shared, and core modules). This approach allows for code reusability, easier testing, and scalable development as the app grows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How do you handle authentication and secure API communication in Angular?</strong><br>
                        Authentication is managed using JWT tokens. The Angular app stores the token securely and attaches it to HTTP requests via interceptors. Route guards protect sensitive routes, and all API calls are made over HTTPS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What strategies do you use for state management and asynchronous data in Angular?</strong><br>
                        Angular services and RxJS observables are used for state management and handling asynchronous data. This enables reactive programming, real-time updates, and efficient data flow between components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How do you implement and test forms with complex validation?</strong><br>
                        Reactive Forms are used for building forms with dynamic and custom validation logic. Unit tests are written for form controls and validation using Jasmine and Karma.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How do you ensure code quality and reliability in an Angular project?</strong><br>
                        The project uses automated unit and integration tests (Jasmine/Karma), code reviews, and code coverage tools. Linting and formatting are enforced for consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How do you integrate Angular with backend APIs and external services?</strong><br>
                        Angular's HttpClient is used to communicate with the backend API and external services. All integrations are handled through secure, centralized endpoints, and error handling is implemented for reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What are best practices for deploying and maintaining Angular applications in production?</strong><br>
                        The app is built and deployed using Angular CLI, with CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps) for automated testing and deployment. Best practices include environment-based configuration, code splitting, lazy loading, and monitoring.
