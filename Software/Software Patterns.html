            Software Patterns: Reusable Solutions for Code

        <!-- Introduction to Software Patterns -->
        <div class="section-card">
            <h2 class="text-blue-800">What are Software Patterns?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Imagine you're building with LEGOs. Instead of figuring out how to build a wheel or a door every single time, you have pre-made pieces that you know how to use. Software patterns are like those pre-made, proven solutions for common problems in building software. They are not finished code, but rather a "recipe" or a "blueprint" that you can follow to solve a specific design challenge in your code.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Using patterns helps you build software faster, make it easier to understand, and ensure it's more reliable and flexible for future changes.</p>

            <h2 class="text-purple-800">Different Kinds of Software Patterns:</h2>

            <!-- Gang of Four (GoF) Patterns Section -->
            <h3 class="text-purple-700">1. Gang of Four (GoF) Patterns</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">These are the classic patterns for object-oriented programming. They help you with how you create objects, how you put code pieces together, and how different parts of your code talk to each other.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Creational Patterns:</strong> Help you create objects in smart ways.
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                        <li>*Examples:* Singleton (only one of something), Factory Method (a "factory" to make things).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Structural Patterns:</strong> Help you arrange code pieces to build bigger, more useful structures.
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                        <li>*Examples:* Adapter (makes two incompatible things work together), Decorator (adds features without changing the original).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns:</strong> Help you manage how different parts of your code communicate and work together.
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                        <li>*Examples:* Observer (one thing watches for changes in another), Strategy (swapping different ways to do something).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) Section -->
            <h3 class="text-teal-700">2. Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">These patterns are about getting different computer systems to talk to each other, especially when they're sending messages back and forth. Think of them as ways to connect different "departments" in a big company's software.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li>*Examples:* Message Channel (a path for messages), Message Router (directs messages to the right place), Message Translator (changes message format).</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Microservices Design Patterns Section -->
            <h3 class="text-orange-700">3. Microservices Design Patterns</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">When you build software as many small, independent services (microservices), these patterns help manage the challenges that come with it, like how they find each other or how to handle failures.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li>*Examples:* API Gateway (a single entry point for all services), Circuit Breaker (stops a failing service from breaking everything), Saga (manages complex tasks across many services).</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Architectural Patterns Section -->
            <h3 class="text-indigo-700">4. Architectural Patterns</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">These are the very high-level blueprints for how an entire software system is structured. They define the big picture of how all the main parts fit together.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li>*Examples:* Layered (like a cake with different layers for different jobs), Client-Server (your phone talks to a central computer), Event-Driven (things happen when "events" occur).</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Cloud Design Patterns Section -->
            <h3 class="text-cyan-700">5. Cloud Design Patterns</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">When you build software to run on cloud services (like Azure, AWS, Google Cloud), these patterns help you make sure your software is super reliable, scales up easily, and uses cloud resources efficiently.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li>*Examples:* Load Balancing (distributes work across many servers), Caching (stores data for quick access), Sharding (splits data across databases).</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Concurrency Patterns Section -->
            <h3 class="text-pink-700">6. Concurrency Patterns</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">These patterns deal with situations where different parts of your code need to run at the same time (concurrently). They help manage shared resources and prevent problems when multiple tasks are happening simultaneously.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li>*Examples:* Producer-Consumer (one part makes things, another uses them), Thread Pool (manages a group of workers), Read-Write Lock (allows many to read, but only one to write).</li>
            </ul>
