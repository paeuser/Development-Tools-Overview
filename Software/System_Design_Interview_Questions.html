            <h2 class="text-blue-800">System Design: How We Build Big Software</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Imagine you want to build a big house. You don't just start nailing boards together. First, you need a plan, right? System design is like creating that detailed plan for building a big software system. It's about figuring out all the parts, how they connect, and how they'll work together to do what you want.</p>

            <h3 class="text-blue-700">Key Parts of Designing Software:</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <strong>Figure out what's needed:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>What it does:</strong> What exactly should the software do? (e.g., "It needs to let people send messages.")</li>
                        <li><strong>How well it does it:</strong> How fast should it be? How many people can use it at once? Will it always be working? Is it safe? (e.g., "Messages must be sent instantly, even if a million people are chatting.")</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Big Picture Plan (High-Level Design):</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Choose the main style:</strong> Decide on the basic way the software will be built. Will it be one big program (like a single block building) or many small, connected programs (like many small houses in a village)?</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify main parts:</strong> Break the big software into smaller, understandable pieces (e.g., "We need a part for users, a part for messages, and a part for saving data.").</li>
                        <li><strong>Show how data moves:</strong> Draw lines to show how information flows from one part to another.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Detailed Plan (Low-Level Design):</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Design each part:</strong> Go into detail for each small piece of the software. How will it work inside?</li>
                        <li><strong>Database blueprint:</strong> Design how the information will be stored, like drawing out the rooms and closets in your house plan for where to put things.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication rules (APIs):</strong> Set clear rules for how different parts of the software talk to each other, like a standard language they all understand.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Making it Handle More (Scalability):</strong> How to make the system work well even if many, many more people start using it.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Add more machines:</strong> Instead of making one machine super powerful, add more regular machines to share the work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make one machine stronger:</strong> Improve a single machine (e.g., give it more memory or a faster processor).</li>
                        <li><strong>Split the data:</strong> Divide the data across many databases so no single one gets overloaded.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick access (Caching):</strong> Store copies of frequently used information closer to the users so they get it faster without bothering the main storage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keeping it Running (Reliability & Availability):</strong> Making sure the software almost never breaks and is always ready to use.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Have backups:</strong> Make extra copies of important parts so if one fails, another can take over.</li>
                        <li><strong>Handle problems gracefully:</strong> Design the system so it can deal with errors without completely crashing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery plan:</strong> Have a plan to get everything back up and running quickly after a big problem.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Making it Fast (Performance):</strong> Making the software respond quickly.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Share the work (Load Balancing):</strong> Send incoming requests to different servers so no single server gets too busy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deliver content fast (CDN):</strong> Store website pictures and videos closer to users around the world so they load quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Database tricks:</strong> Make the database find information faster.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keeping it Safe (Security):</strong> Protecting the software from bad guys and accidents.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Who are you? (Authentication):</strong> Make sure only real users can get in.</li>
                        <li><strong>What can you do? (Authorization):</strong> Make sure users can only do what they're allowed to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scramble data (Encryption):</strong> Protect information when it's moving around or being stored.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit requests:</strong> Stop people from sending too many requests at once, which could be an attack.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy to Change & Grow (Maintainability & Extensibility):</strong> Making it simple to fix bugs, add new features, and update the software later.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Small, separate pieces:</strong> Break the software into independent parts that are easier to work on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't rely too much:</strong> Make sure parts of the software don't depend too heavily on each other.</li>
                        <li><strong>See what's happening (Observability):</strong> Set up ways to watch how the system is working, like logs and performance charts, so you know if something's wrong.</li>

            <p class="mb-4">System design interviews are where interviewers check if you can plan and build big software systems. They want to see how you think about problems and make smart choices, because there's usually no single "perfect" answer.</p>

                        <li><strong>Good choices vs. bad choices:</strong> Talk about why you picked a certain way to build it (e.g., "I chose small, separate programs because we expect a lot of growth, even though it's more complex to start.").</li>
