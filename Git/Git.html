<h2>Git Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>git rebase</strong>: Moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Useful for updating a feature branch with the latest changes from main, or for cleaning up commit history. Rewrites commit history to make it linear.</li>
  <li><strong>git merge</strong>: Combines changes from one branch into another, creating a new merge commit. Preserves the full branch history.</li>
  <li><strong>git push</strong>: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.</li>
  <li><strong>git pull</strong>: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into your current branch.</li>
  <li><strong>git commit --amend</strong>: Modifies the most recent commit.</li>
  <li><strong>git reset</strong>: Moves the current branch to a specified commit, optionally modifying the working directory and staging area.</li>
  <li><strong>git log</strong>: Shows the commit history for the current branch.</li>
  <li><strong>git status</strong>: Displays the state of the working directory and staging area.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you accidentally commit sensitive information (like API tokens or passwords) to your repository, GitHub will block your push to protect your project. In these cases, you must remove the secret from your files and also from your git history. This is why we use <strong>git rebase</strong> (or similar history-rewriting commands) to edit or remove problematic commits before pushing again. Rebasing allows you to rewrite your commit history, ensuring that secrets are completely removed from all previous commits, not just the latest one.</p>
