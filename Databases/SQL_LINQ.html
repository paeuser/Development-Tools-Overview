        <tr>
            <td>What is LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a .NET framework component that adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages using a syntax similar to SQL.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is deferred execution in LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">Deferred execution means that a LINQ query is not executed until its results are enumerated, allowing for optimized query execution.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is the difference between SQL and LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">SQL is a query language for relational databases, while LINQ is a .NET framework feature that allows querying of various data sources, including databases, collections, and XML, using a unified syntax.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is a lambda expression in LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">A lambda expression is an anonymous function used to create delegates or expression tree types, often used in LINQ queries for concise syntax.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What are LINQ query operators?</td>
            <td class="answer">LINQ query operators are methods that operate on sequences and allow querying, filtering, and transforming data. Examples include Select, Where, and OrderBy.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is LINQ to SQL?</td>
            <td class="answer">LINQ to SQL is a component of LINQ that provides a runtime infrastructure for managing relational data as objects without losing the ability to query.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is LINQ to XML?</td>
            <td class="answer">LINQ to XML is a LINQ provider that allows querying and manipulating XML documents using LINQ syntax.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is the purpose of the GroupBy operator in LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">The GroupBy operator in LINQ is used to group elements of a sequence based on a specified key selector function.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is the difference between LINQ and Entity Framework?</td>
            <td class="answer">LINQ is a query syntax in .NET for querying data, while Entity Framework is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that uses LINQ to query databases.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is the Select operator in LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">The Select operator is used to project each element of a sequence into a new form, often transforming the data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is LINQ to Objects?</td>
            <td class="answer">LINQ to Objects allows querying in-memory collections like arrays, lists, and dictionaries using LINQ syntax.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is the purpose of the Where operator in LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">The Where operator is used to filter a sequence of values based on a predicate function.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is the difference between First and FirstOrDefault in LINQ?</td>
            <td class="answer">First throws an exception if no elements are found, while FirstOrDefault returns a default value instead.</td>
