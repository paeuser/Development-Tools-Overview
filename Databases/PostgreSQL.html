        <tr>
            <td>Is PostgreSQL similar to SQL Server?</td>
            <td class="answer">PostgreSQL and SQL Server are both relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they differ in several ways. PostgreSQL is open-source, highly extensible, and cross-platform, while SQL Server is a proprietary product by Microsoft, primarily designed for Windows with enterprise-level support. Both are powerful, but the choice depends on specific requirements and ecosystem.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Is PostgreSQL similar to MongoDB?</td>
            <td class="answer">PostgreSQL and MongoDB are both database systems, but they are fundamentally different. PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL and enforces a structured schema. MongoDB, on the other hand, is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data. The choice between them depends on the application's data model and requirements.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>What is pgAdmin 4?</td>
            <td class="answer">pgAdmin is an open-source, web-based administration and development platform for PostgreSQL. It provides a graphical interface to manage PostgreSQL databases, execute SQL queries, and perform various administrative tasks such as creating tables, managing users, and monitoring database performance.</td>
