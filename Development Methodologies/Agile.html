    <h1>Agile Methodology</h1>
    <h2>What is Agile?</h2>
    <p>Agile is a modern software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Work is divided into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changes and deliver value continuously.</p>
    <h2>Key Principles of Agile</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Iterative and incremental development</li>
        <li>Frequent delivery of working software</li>
        <li>Collaboration between cross-functional teams</li>
        <li>Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development</li>
        <li>Continuous feedback and improvement</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
    <p>Scrum is a popular Agile framework that structures development in fixed-length cycles called sprints (usually 2-4 weeks). Scrum defines specific roles, events, and artifacts to help teams deliver value efficiently.</p>
    <h3>Scrum Roles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Defines the product vision and prioritizes the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> Facilitates the process, removes obstacles, and ensures Scrum practices are followed.</li>
        <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Builds the product and delivers increments each sprint.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scrum Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> A time-boxed period to deliver a usable product increment.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Meeting to decide what will be done in the sprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> Short daily meeting to synchronize work and plan for the next 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> Meeting to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> Meeting to reflect and improve the process.</li>
    </ul>
