    <h1>Waterfall Model</h1>
    <h2>What is the Waterfall Model?</h2>
    <p>The Waterfall model is a traditional software development methodology where the process flows in a linear, sequential order. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, and there is little to no overlap between phases.</p>
    <h2>Phases of the Waterfall Model</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Gather and document what the software must do.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Plan the software architecture and design the solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Write the actual code based on the design.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Test the software to find and fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Release the finished product to users.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Fix issues and make improvements after deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one.</li>
        <li>Best for projects with well-understood requirements and low risk of changes.</li>
        <li>Simple to understand and manage, but not flexible for changes during development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Differences between Agile and Waterfall</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterfall:</strong> Linear and sequential; each phase must finish before the next starts; changes are hard to accommodate once a phase is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile:</strong> Iterative and incremental; work is divided into small cycles (sprints); changes and feedback are welcomed throughout the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Difference between Scrum and Agile</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Agile:</strong> Agile is a broad set of principles and values for software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. It is a mindset or philosophy.</li>
        <li><strong>Scrum:</strong> Scrum is a specific framework that implements Agile principles. It provides a structured way to organize work in sprints, with defined roles, events, and artifacts. All Scrum is Agile, but not all Agile is Scrum.</li>
