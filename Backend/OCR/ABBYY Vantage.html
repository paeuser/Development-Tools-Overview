    <h1>ABBYY Vantage OCR Resources</h1>
    <p><strong>ABBYY Vantage</strong> is an advanced cloud-based platform for intelligent document processing (IDP) and optical character recognition (OCR). It enables organizations to automate the extraction of data from documents, classify content, and integrate with business workflows using AI-driven skills and connectors. Vantage provides prebuilt and customizable solutions for a wide range of document types and industries.</p>
    <h2>Example: AI-Powered Invoice Data Extraction</h2>
    <p><strong>Without AI:</strong> Employees manually review invoices, type amounts, dates, and vendor names into accounting systems. This is slow, error-prone, and costly.</p>
    <p><strong>With AI (ABBYY Vantage):</strong> The platform automatically scans invoices, recognizes key fields (like total, date, vendor), and exports the data directly to your business software. This saves time, reduces errors, and lets staff focus on higher-value work.</p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> Many traditional OCR and automation solutions (including early ABBYY products) used rule-based templates and pattern matching, not true AI. Modern AI-powered document processing uses machine learning to adapt to new layouts and extract data more flexibly, but not all "automation" is AI. Be sure to check if a solution uses real AI/ML or just classic automation.

        <strong>Sample: AI/ML in ABBYY Vantage</strong><br>
        <em>Scenario:</em> You receive a batch of mixed business documents (invoices, purchase orders, contracts) in various formats and layouts.<br><br>
        <strong>With Vantage AI/ML:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Vantage uses pre-trained and custom machine learning models to <b>classify</b> each document type automatically, even if the layout is new or has changed.</li>
            <li>It applies AI-powered <b>data extraction skills</b> to locate and extract key fields (e.g., invoice number, total, PO date) based on context, not just fixed positions.</li>
            <li>The system <b>learns from corrections</b> made by users, improving accuracy over time (continuous learning).</li>
            <li>All extracted data is validated and exported to your business system with minimal manual review.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> Unlike classic automation, Vantage's AI/ML adapts to new document types and layouts, reducing setup time and maintenance, and increasing accuracy for real-world, variable documents.
