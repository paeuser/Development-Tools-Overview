        </p>

        <p><strong>1) Salary Expectation Question:</strong> When a recruiter calls, it is <span style="color: #d32f2f; font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> the time to negotiate. <span style="color: #d32f2f; font-weight: bold;">DON'T NEGOTIATE</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not bring up your past salary. The recruiter wants to close you as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>What you say now might be too high or too low; you can always discuss numbers later in the process once you have more information from the hiring manager.</li>
            <li>It's important to discover the salary range first.</li>
            <li>If asked about your expectations, respond that it's too early in the process and there are many variables at play. After learning more about the company, the role, and the scope of the job, you’re confident you can reach an agreement together.</li>
            <li><span class="tip">Sample response:</span> <em>"It's a bit early in the process—there are a lot of variables at play. Once I learn more about the company, the role, and the scope, I'm sure we can agree on something that's fair for both sides."</em></li>
            <li>Then, <b>start</b> asking questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your budget and salary band for this role?</li>
                    <li>In some states like California, employers are required to provide this range/band.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What is a salary band?</strong> A salary band is a defined pay range for a job role that sets the minimum, midpoint, and maximum salary based on factors like experience, performance, and market rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2) Find Out Their Leverage:</strong> Just as you have leverage, learn about theirs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How long has this position been open?</li>
            <li>What is the budget for this role?</li>
            <li>Are they raising a new round of equity?</li>
            <li>Is there a hiring freeze?</li>
            <li>How is the offer decision approved?</li>
            <li>What is the company's compensation philosophy?</li>
            <li>What are some comparable levels at companies like Meta or Google? (For example, they might say this is an E5 at Meta.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Explanation of Engineering Levels & Equity</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Meta (formerly Facebook) Engineering Levels:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>E3</strong> – Entry-Level Software Engineer (new grad or 0–1 years of experience)</li>
            <li><strong>E4</strong> – Software Engineer (1–3 years of experience)</li>
            <li><strong>E5</strong> – Senior Software Engineer (typically 3–6 years)</li>
            <li><strong>E6</strong> – Staff Software Engineer (more experienced senior engineer)</li>
            <li><strong>E7</strong> – Senior Staff Engineer</li>
            <li><strong>E8+</strong> – Engineering Director / Principal Engineer / Leadership roles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Why does level matter?</strong> Figuring out what level you are interviewing for is important, as it directly impacts your compensation and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>E3 – Approx. $192K</li>
            <li>E4 – Approx. $250K</li>
            <li>E6 – Approx. $650K</li>
            <li>E9 – Approx. $2.53M</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3) Process:</strong> Ask about the timeline between the first interview and receiving an offer, and when you’ll get specific details on equity and salary. This helps you identify key decision-makers and plan your negotiation strategy.</p>
