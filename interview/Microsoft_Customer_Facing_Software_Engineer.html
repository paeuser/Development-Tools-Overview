    <h2 style="color:#005a9e;">Personal Experience: Insights from a CFSE</h2>
    <p>
        I had a friend who worked as a Customer Facing Software Engineer (CFSE) at Microsoft. He said it was a great role that allowed him to work closely with customers while also doing hands-on coding and development work. He really enjoyed the mix of technical challenges and customer interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before, the role was called Premier Field Engineer (PFE) and was more focused on support. Now, it has evolved to include more proactive solution development and customer engagement. This change was made to align with the market and better support sales teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        He used to help customers adopt Microsoft products, working primarily with Microsoft 365, especially SharePoint and Power Apps. He was very passionate about his job—something typical of Microsoft employees.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I asked him what it was like to work as a CFSE, he emphasized the opportunity to work closely with customers and the hands-on coding and development work. He enjoyed the blend of technical challenges and customer interaction.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color:#0078d4;">Typical Routine</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Helping customers overcome roadblocks when using Microsoft products</li>
        <li>Delivering training, such as Power Apps workshops</li>
        <li>Advising on governance implementation for Teams</li>
        <li>Occasionally taking phone calls to answer questions or provide guidance</li>
        <li>Collaborating with customers to plan how they want to use Microsoft technologies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are different groups within Microsoft for which these positions exist, such as Teams, SharePoint, and Power Apps.
