IMPORTANT: When running this prompt on a file (e.g., interview/interviewDefault2.html or interviewDefault3 whelen.html), FIRST remove all content except the Company Details and Interview Preparation Notes headings. Only these two headings should remain. Do NOT add or keep any other content or sections. Then, update the Company Details section (the left column) with the new job description provided by the recruiter. DO NOT overwrite or remove the right column (interview notes). The right column should always be preserved unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
