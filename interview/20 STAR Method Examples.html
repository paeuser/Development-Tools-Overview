                <p class="mb-2"><span class="star-label">Situation:</span> A long-standing client application had accumulated significant technical debt, making it slow to develop new features and increasing the risk of outages.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><span class="star-label">Task:</span> My task was to assess the technical debt, propose a remediation plan, and lead the refactoring efforts.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><span class="star-label">Action:</span> I performed a codebase analysis to identify hotspots of complexity and outdated patterns. I then worked with the client to allocate dedicated "tech debt sprints," where we systematically refactored modules, updated libraries, and improved unit test coverage.</p>
                <p><span class="star-label">Result:</span> Over three months, we reduced the technical debt by 25%, leading to a 15% increase in feature delivery speed and a noticeable decrease in production incidents.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-3">20. Cross-Functional Collaboration</h3>
                <p class="mb-2"><span class="star-label">Situation:</span> A new product launch required close collaboration between engineering, marketing, and sales teams, but they operated in silos, leading to miscommunication.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><span class="star-label">Task:</span> My task was to facilitate effective communication and collaboration across these diverse functional teams to ensure a smooth product launch.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><span class="star-label">Action:</span> I established a shared communication channel (e.g., Slack, Teams), set up regular cross-functional sync meetings, and created a centralized dashboard to track progress and dependencies. I also acted as a bridge, translating technical details for non-technical teams and vice versa.</p>
                <p><span class="star-label">Result:</span> The product launched on time and within budget, with all teams aligned on goals and progress. Post-launch feedback indicated significantly improved inter-departmental understanding and efficiency.</p>
