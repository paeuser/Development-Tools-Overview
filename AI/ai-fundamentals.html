            <p>Welcome to the AI Fundamentals page. Here, you will find resources and information to help you understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> A subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Netflix:</strong> Recommends shows based on what you’ve watched.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spam Filters:</strong> Detect junk email.</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Driving Cars:</strong> Recognize stop signs, people, and other cars.</li>
                        <li><strong>Banking:</strong> Detect fraud by spotting unusual activity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex data.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> A type of machine learning that identifies patterns in data without labeled examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Techniques for enabling machines to understand and process human language.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> The field of AI focused on enabling machines to interpret and analyze visual data.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> A type of machine learning where agents learn by interacting with their environment to maximize rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics in AI:</strong> Discussion on the ethical implications and responsible use of AI technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>ML Model (Machine Learning Model):</strong> A program or algorithm that learns patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.</li>
                <li><strong>DS Model (Data Science Model):</strong> A data-driven analytical model—often using statistical or machine learning techniques—to extract insights, identify trends, or solve business problems.</li>
