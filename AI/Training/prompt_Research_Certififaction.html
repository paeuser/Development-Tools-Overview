<p>
situation:<br>
I'm a full stack developer with 20 years of experience, working with web technologies, databases, and .NET C#.<br>
My contract ended.
</p>
<p>
What do I want? I don't know.<br>
But here are some brainstorming thoughts.<br>
I don't want to waste time.<br>
I want to incorporate an AI plan, probably a certification.<br>
I talked to a CareerSource Florida representative who suggested contacting the Miami EdTech Team,<br>
but that company does not answer their emails nor their phone. I also drove to the facility and it is a wrong address.<br>
My plan is to have CareerSource Florida pay for an apprenticeship program where I can learn and get paid.
</p>
<p>
My goal is not to get overwhelmed by an overflow of information.<br>
My goal is to complement my background with some AI.<br>
I don't know what will be the most efficient way.
</p>
<p>
Here is the 1 question. Once you answer it, I will add it to this list so I have a record!<br>
1) Is there any other school in the US that I can call that offers such an apprenticeship program so CareerSource Florida can pay for it?<br>
Please provide a list of the websites and contacts so I can call.
