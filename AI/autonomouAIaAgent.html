        <p class="lead">Autonomous AI agents are advanced systems capable of performing tasks independently, making decisions, and adapting to new information without human intervention.</p>

        <section class="my-4">
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Decision-making capabilities</li>
                <li>Self-learning through machine learning algorithms</li>
                <li>Adaptability to dynamic environments</li>
                <li>Task automation and optimization</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="my-4">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Autonomous AI agents are used in various fields, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="my-4">
            <h2>Official Website</h2>
            <p>The official website for Manus AI is: <a href="https://manus.im" target="_blank">https://manus.im</a>. This is a sample of an autonomous AI agent.</p>
        </section>
        <p>I can give it a goal, and it can go through the internet and execute tasks for me.</p>
        <p>It can run multiple processes in parallel, enhancing efficiency and productivity.</p>
        <p>It can book a trip, analyze the stock market, build websites, and manage tasks. It's like hiring a $10,000 assistant project manager or research assistant for just $2 a task or something similar.</p>
        <p>It is getting much smarter with every iteration, continuously improving its capabilities.</p>
        <p>With Manus, instead of searching many sites to plan a trip, I can just enter prompts, and it will handle the rest efficiently.</p>
