agent ai : are intelligent system that perceive information , processes it to understand context , and autonomouly acts to achive specidic 
objective adapting to changes in its eviroment  

they can take action in response to the data and initiate action proactibly

add below notes 

here is the agentic ai technical definition 
THINK OF agentic ai agents  as large language models with set of tools that sre used in a reasoning action loop 
this allow ai agent systems to perform more complex functions than any vanilla LLM 
SO TAKING THIS ANOLOGY A GENERIC ai COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS	 A SKILLED WRITER who can draft excellent content on any topic 
than you can provide 
but an agent Ai WILL be like a personal assitant who can not only write but also able to understand your goals and needs 
and they can also take actions like schedualling meeting , book travel and manage aby other tasks morre proactively 
so in the agen workflow we can observe tha he agent takes feedback and revises its responsive as well 
this doea not hapen in avery workflow
