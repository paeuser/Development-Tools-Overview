    <h1>Distributed Systems</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Distributed Systems page. Here, we will explore the concepts, architecture, and tools used in distributed systems, including microservices and message brokers like RabbitMQ.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Distributed Systems</h2>

    <h3>General Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is a distributed system?</strong><br>A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the users as a single coherent system.</li>
        <li><strong>What are the key challenges in distributed systems?</strong><br>Challenges include fault tolerance, scalability, consistency, and latency.</li>
        <li><strong>What is the CAP theorem?</strong><br>The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Microservices Architecture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What are microservices?</strong><br>Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain.</li>
        <li><strong>What are the benefits of microservices?</strong><br>Benefits include scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>How do you handle communication between microservices?</strong><br>Communication can be handled using REST APIs, gRPC, or message brokers like RabbitMQ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Service Bus and Message Brokers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is a message broker?</strong><br>A message broker is software that enables communication between different applications or services by translating messages between formal messaging protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>What is RabbitMQ?</strong><br>RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that supports multiple messaging protocols and is widely used for implementing message queues.</li>
        <li><strong>What are the advantages of using a service bus?</strong><br>Advantages include decoupling of services, scalability, and reliable message delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advanced Topics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is eventual consistency?</strong><br>Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems where updates to a database will propagate to all nodes eventually.</li>
        <li><strong>What is a saga pattern?</strong><br>The saga pattern is a design pattern for managing distributed transactions by breaking them into a series of smaller, independent steps.</li>
        <li><strong>How do you monitor and debug distributed systems?</strong><br>Use tools like distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin), centralized logging, and monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).</li>
    </ul>
