    <dl>
        <dt><b>AI</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Artificial Intelligence. Technology that makes computers act like humans—learning, reasoning, and solving problems.</dd>

        <dt><b>Machine Learning Models</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Programs that learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task.</dd>

        <dt><b>AI Services</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Cloud-based tools (like Azure Cognitive Services) that let you add AI features (vision, speech, language, etc.) to your apps easily.</dd>

        <dt><b>Prompt Engineering</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Designing and refining the instructions (prompts) you give to AI models (like ChatGPT) to get the best results.</dd>

        <dt><b>Custom Code</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Writing your own software to solve a problem, instead of using only pre-built tools or services.</dd>

        <dt><b>Azure AI Foundry</b>:</dt>
        <dd>A Microsoft platform that helps you build, deploy, and manage AI solutions using Azure’s cloud tools and services. It brings together data, models, and deployment in one place.</dd>

        <dt><b>Generative AI</b>:</dt>
        <dd>The ability to create original responses or content from natural language prompts. Example: Automatically generating property descriptions for real estate listings.</dd>

        <dt><b>Agents</b>:</dt>
        <dd>AI applications that can respond to user input or situations and take actions on their own. Example: An executive assistant agent that can provide meeting details or book a taxi for you.</dd>

        <dt><b>Computer Vision</b>:</dt>
        <dd>The ability for software to understand and process images or video. Example: Identifying products in a shopping basket using a camera, without scanning barcodes.</dd>

        <dt><b>Speech</b>:</dt>
        <dd>The ability to recognize spoken words and generate speech. Example: A digital assistant that lets you ask questions by speaking and gives answers out loud.</dd>

        <dt><b>Natural Language Processing</b>:</dt>
        <dd>The ability to understand, analyze, and generate human language in text or speech. Example: Analyzing social media posts for sentiment or translating messages.</dd>

        <dt><b>Information Extraction</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Using AI to pull out important details from documents, images, or recordings. Example: Extracting dates and totals from a scanned receipt for expense claims.</dd>

        <dt><b>Decision Support</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Using data and AI to make predictions that help with business decisions. Example: Predicting real estate market trends based on city data.</dd>

        <dt><b>GPT family</b>:</dt>
        <dd>A group of advanced AI language models (like GPT-3, GPT-4) that can understand and generate human-like text for answering questions, writing content, and more.</dd>

        <dt><b>DALL-E image-generation</b>:</dt>
        <dd>An AI model that creates original images from text descriptions. Example: You type "a cat riding a skateboard" and DALL-E draws it for you.</dd>

        <dt><b>Vector Indexes</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Special databases that store information as number lists (vectors) so AI can quickly find and compare similar things—like searching for documents or images that are related in meaning, not just by exact words.</dd>

        <dt><b>BICEP or ARM templates</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Files that describe Azure resources and their settings, so you can create or update everything automatically in the cloud. BICEP is a newer, easier-to-read language; ARM is the older JSON format.</dd>

        <dt><b>Azure Foundry hub</b>:</dt>
        <dd>A central place in Azure to manage, share, and control access to AI resources and costs for your team or project. It helps organize and monitor all your AI services in one spot.</dd>
