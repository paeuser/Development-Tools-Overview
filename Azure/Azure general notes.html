        <h3>Why You Need to Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
        <p>
            Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring both a password and a second verification step, like a code sent to your phone. This helps protect your organization's data from unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised. Enabling MFA is part of a broader effort to improve security and meet compliance standards.

        <h2>What is Premium Access (Microsoft Entra ID Premium)?</h2>
        <p>Premium Access means you're using a paid plan of Microsoft Entra ID that gives you advanced identity and security features, like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conditional Access (smart rules for sign-in)</li>
            <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
            <li>Device compliance checks (like Intune)</li>
            <li>Risk-based sign-in protections</li>
            <li>Self-service password reset and group management</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Free Azure Credits & Premium Features</h3>
        <p>If you're using free Azure credits (like the Azure Free Trial or Visual Studio benefit), here’s what that means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>✅ What You Get (During Free Credit Period):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can try Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 features for free, including:</li>
                    <li>Conditional Access</li>
                    <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
                    <li>Risk-based sign-in protection</li>
                    <li>Self-service password reset</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>⏳ But It's Temporary:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once your free credits or trial period expire, premium features stop working unless you upgrade to a paid plan (e.g., P1 or P2).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Note:</strong> You might lose access to Conditional Access policies you created, and only basic sign-in and security options will remain.
