        <li><b>What is a stage in a pipeline?</b><br><i>A logical boundary in a pipeline representing a phase (e.g., build, test, deploy).</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a job in a pipeline?</b><br><i>A job is a collection of steps run sequentially on the same agent.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a step in a pipeline?</b><br><i>A step is a single task, script, or action within a job.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you secure secrets in pipelines?</b><br><i>By using secret variables, Azure Key Vault, or GitHub Secrets to store sensitive data.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is environment in Azure DevOps?</b><br><i>An environment represents a target for deployment, such as dev, test, or production.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a service connection?</b><br><i>A secure connection to external services/resources (e.g., Azure, Docker Hub) used in pipelines.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you implement approvals in pipelines?</b><br><i>By configuring manual approval gates before or after stages/environments.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a self-hosted agent?</b><br><i>An agent you install and manage on your own infrastructure for custom builds or deployments.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a hosted agent?</b><br><i>An agent provided and managed by Microsoft or GitHub, running in the cloud.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you reuse pipeline code?</b><br><i>By using templates (YAML includes) or composite actions in GitHub Actions.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a pipeline variable?</b><br><i>A value used in pipelines for configuration, which can be set at queue time, in YAML, or in the UI.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you handle pipeline failures?</b><br><i>By reviewing logs, using retry strategies, and setting up notifications for failed runs.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a pull request validation pipeline?</b><br><i>A pipeline that runs automatically to validate code changes in a pull request before merging.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you deploy to Azure from a pipeline?</b><br><i>By using Azure CLI, ARM/Bicep templates, or built-in Azure deployment tasks/actions.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a matrix build?</b><br><i>Running the same job with different parameters (e.g., OS, language version) in parallel.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a pipeline artifact?</b><br><i>A file or set of files published by a pipeline for sharing between jobs or stages.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a GitHub workflow?</b><br><i>A YAML file in the .github/workflows directory that defines automation for your repository.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you cache dependencies in pipelines?</b><br><i>By using cache tasks/actions to speed up builds by reusing previously downloaded dependencies.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a deployment strategy?</b><br><i>A method for rolling out changes, such as blue-green, canary, or rolling deployments.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is infrastructure as code (IaC)?</b><br><i>Managing infrastructure using code (e.g., ARM, Bicep, Terraform) for repeatable deployments.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you integrate tests in CI/CD?</b><br><i>By adding test steps/tasks in the pipeline to run unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a GitHub Action?</b><br><i>A reusable unit of automation in GitHub Actions, defined in a repository or published on the Marketplace.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you rollback a deployment?</b><br><i>By redeploying a previous artifact or using deployment slots/environments.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a pipeline template?</b><br><i>A reusable YAML file that defines common pipeline logic for inclusion in multiple pipelines.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a build trigger?</b><br><i>An event that starts a build, such as a code push, PR, or schedule.</i></li>

        <li><b>What is a deployment slot?</b><br><i>A live environment for staging deployments before swapping to production (e.g., in Azure App Service).</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you use Key Vault in pipelines?</b><br><i>By linking Azure Key Vault to your pipeline and referencing secrets as variables.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a conditional step?</b><br><i>A step that runs only if certain conditions are met (e.g., based on variables or previous step results).</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a GitHub runner?</b><br><i>A machine that executes GitHub Actions workflows (hosted or self-hosted).</i></li>

        <li><b>How do you handle secrets in GitHub Actions?</b><br><i>By storing them in GitHub Secrets and referencing them in workflow YAML.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a release gate?</b><br><i>A precondition (e.g., approval, query, or check) that must be met before a release proceeds.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you use environment variables in pipelines?</b><br><i>By defining them in YAML, pipeline settings, or as secrets, and referencing them in steps.</i></li>
        <li><b>What is a build artifact?</b><br><i>The output of a build process, such as binaries, packages, or container images.</i></li>
        <li><b>How do you integrate code quality checks?</b><br><i>By adding static analysis, linting, or security scanning tasks to your pipeline.</i></li>
