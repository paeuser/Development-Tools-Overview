It might refer to highly optimized scenarios where memory allocations are minimized to reduce GC pressure, or perhaps a misunderstanding of how GC works. .NET always uses a garbage collector (like the Workstation GC or Server GC) to manage memory automatically.

                        <td data-label="Explanation">Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. In .NET Core, DI is a first-class citizen, built into the framework. It allows for loose coupling, easier testing, and better maintainability by providing dependencies to a class rather than the class creating them itself. Services are typically registered in the `Startup.cs` file.</td>

                                <li><strong>Razor Pages:</strong> A page-based model for building web UI, simplifying the development of page-focused scenarios. Each page is self-contained with its view and code-behind file. Ideal for simpler web pages and form-based applications where the UI logic is tightly coupled to the page.</li>
