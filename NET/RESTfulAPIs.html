        <tr>
            <td>What is a RESTful API?</td>
            <td class="answer">A RESTful API is an application programming interface that adheres to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), enabling interaction with web services using standard HTTP methods.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What are the HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?</td>
            <td class="answer">The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS, each serving a specific purpose in CRUD operations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is statelessness in REST?</td>
            <td class="answer">Statelessness means that each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, with no reliance on stored context on the server.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is a resource in REST?</td>
            <td class="answer">A resource is any piece of information that can be named and manipulated via a RESTful API, typically represented by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is JSON in RESTful APIs?</td>
            <td class="answer">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a client and a server in RESTful APIs.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is HATEOAS?</td>
            <td class="answer">HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of REST that allows clients to dynamically navigate resources through hyperlinks provided in responses.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is versioning in RESTful APIs?</td>
            <td class="answer">Versioning is the practice of managing changes to an API by providing different versions, often indicated in the URI or headers, to ensure backward compatibility.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is an API gateway?</td>
            <td class="answer">An API gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for API requests, handling tasks such as request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is CORS in RESTful APIs?</td>
            <td class="answer">CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What is an API key?</td>
            <td class="answer">An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize access to an API, ensuring secure communication between the client and the server.</td>
