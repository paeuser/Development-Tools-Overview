                <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md flex flex-col">
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-3">1. How does the .NET framework work?</p>
                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <p>The .NET Framework is a software development platform for building and running applications on Windows. It consists of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which handles execution, memory management, and security, and the Framework Class Library (FCL), a vast collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <p>Major components include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Common Language Runtime (CLR):</strong> The execution engine that provides services like garbage collection, security, and exception handling.</li>
                            <li><strong>Framework Class Library (FCL):</strong> A comprehensive, object-oriented collection of reusable types that provides functionality for various tasks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Common Type System (CTS):</strong> Defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the CLR.</li>
                            <li><strong>Common Language Specification (CLS):</strong> A set of rules that define the minimum features required for .NET languages to interoperate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Metadata and Assemblies:</strong> Assemblies are the fundamental units of deployment, versioning, reuse, and security in .NET. Metadata describes the types defined within an assembly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>EXE (Executable):</strong> A file that contains an application's executable code. It has an entry point (e.g., `Main` method) and can be run directly.</li>
                            <li><strong>DLL (Dynamic Link Library):</strong> A library file that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. It does not have an entry point and cannot be run directly. DLLs promote code reuse.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-3">4. What is CTS?</p>
                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <p><strong>CTS (Common Type System)</strong> is a standard that specifies how types are declared, used, and managed in the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It ensures that types defined in different .NET languages can interoperate with each other by providing a common set of data types and operations.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <!-- Question 5 -->

                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <p><strong>CLS (Common Language Specification)</strong> is a subset of the Common Type System (CTS) that defines a set of rules and guidelines that language compilers must follow to produce code that can interoperate with other .NET languages. It ensures cross-language compatibility.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <p><strong>JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler</strong> is a component of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) that converts Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) code into native machine code at runtime, just before the code is executed. This allows for platform independence and optimized execution for the specific CPU architecture.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <!-- Question 7 -->

                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-3">7. What is the difference between int and Int32?</p>
                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><code>int</code>:</strong> This is a C# keyword (an alias) for the `System.Int32` type. Its actual size (32-bit or 64-bit) depends on the underlying system and the .NET version, but in modern .NET, it typically maps to `Int32`.</li>
                            <li><strong><code>Int32</code>:</strong> This is the actual .NET Framework type (`System.Int32`) that represents a 32-bit signed integer. It has a fixed size across all .NET languages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In most practical scenarios, they are interchangeable in C#, but `Int32` is the explicit type from the FCL, while `int` is a language-specific shortcut.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 max-w-none">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Value Type:</strong> Stores its data directly in its own memory allocation (usually on the stack). When a value type is assigned to another variable, its value is copied. Examples: `int`, `char`, `struct`, `enum`.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reference Type:</strong> Stores a reference (memory address) to its data, which is stored on the heap. When a reference type is assigned to another variable, only the reference is copied, pointing to the same data in memory. Examples: `class`, `string`, `array`, `delegate`.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Managed Code:</strong> Code that is executed and managed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR provides services like automatic garbage collection, type safety, and security. Most C#, VB.NET code is managed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unmanaged Code:</strong> Code that is executed directly by the operating system, outside the control of the CLR. It requires manual memory management and can be less secure. Examples include C++ code, Win32 APIs, and COM components.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                            <li><strong>ASP (Active Server Pages):</strong> An older, interpreted, server-side scripting environment (using VBScript or JScript) for building dynamic web pages. It's procedural and less structured.</li>
                            <li><strong>ASP.NET:</strong> A compiled, object-oriented framework for building dynamic web applications and web services. It's part of the .NET Framework, offering better performance, security, and a rich set of controls and features (like Web Forms, MVC, Web API).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>ASP.NET is a complete rewrite and significant advancement over classic ASP.</p>
