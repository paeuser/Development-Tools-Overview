This project consists of a directory containing subdirectories. Each subdirectory has its own index.html.
The root index.html includes links to each subdirectoryâ€™s index.html, using the name of the subdirectory as the link text.
All HTML files in every subdirectory must include a <link rel="stylesheet" href="../site.css"> (or the correct relative path) in the <head> and should not have inline <style> blocks. This ensures a consistent look and feel across the project.
This is simple HTML that should be easily viewable in desktop browsers as well as on mobile browsers.

 only display index.html if its root folder has subfolder(s), and only include a 'Back to Main Index' link if the current folder contains subfolders.
Do not include any 'Back to Main Index' or 'index.html' links in subdirectory index.html files unless explicitly requested. Never add self-referential or back-to-root index links by default.
